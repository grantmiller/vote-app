1. Get the application URL by running these commands:

  NOTE: It may take a few minutes for the LoadBalancer IP to be available.
        You can watch the status by running 'kubectl get svc -w'.

  export SERVICE_IP=$(kubectl get svc {{ include "vote-app.fullname" . }} -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
  echo http://$SERVICE_IP/

If using ClusterIP service, port-forward instead:

  kubectl port-forward svc/{{ include "vote-app.fullname" . }} 8080:80
  echo http://localhost:8080/
